Welcome to the first weekly WBS SERVICES report . 
Fixed site issues
This week's report is as follows:

ALGORITHMS!
______________________
- Developed system for organising data in webtrees.
- Started development on porting CowM to ArduinoQ-compatible(?) model type
- Solved how to convert 2D array to 3D space efficiently...

APPLICATIONS!
_____________________
- WBS Services placeholder (this)
- Aforementioned data org system
- Working on method to allow Debian Linux (and Windows) to interface with
the drone's camera and input system since emulating Android doesn't
allow the data to passthrough 
- Working on Q firmware to control drone

SPECULATIONS!
_____________________
- Drone camera access by the Q might be a lengthy hurdle
- The controller IC is proprietary; maybe good idea to make wire harness to buttons/potentiometers?
- Wondering about proposed alternative propeller design
- Potentially find better camera/visual hardware? Range is extremely limited via WiFi
- I think the controller is a lot higher range than the WiFi but that's up to further testing

PLANS!
____________________
- Get something other than KY UFO to connect to the drone
- Finish Q firmware
- Modify drone body to a moderate extent with the hopes of improving functionality at the cost of a little bit of light-ness(???)


That's what's going on this week, I think.
Thanks, 
Jodell
